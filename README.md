# My OpenCL Toolkit

This CMake-based project contains some wrappers around the OpenCL functions I use frequently. 
The wrappers are mainly concerned with throwing an exception with **meaningful** error messages in case of errors or **ensuring** that the target devices are always shut down properly and all alocated ressources are released.
Occasionally this library will be expanded by me over time.
